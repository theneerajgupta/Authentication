# Objectives

The intention of this project is simple. Understand different ways in which I can perform user authentication and then save the code here for future reference. The key to any form of learning endeavour is repetition. I will be the first one to admit that we constantly live in a state of 'out of time', that makes us rush our decisions and puts unrealistic pressures. Here, we rise above it. We accept challenges because we want to, the the longer route to understand the value of the shortcuts available to us. Here we understand the essence of code.

By the end of this project, i wish to learn the following
- [ ] password based authentication
- [ ] password less authentication
  - [ ] magic links
  - [ ] one time password
  - [ ] whatsapp authentication
  - [ ] passkeys
  - [ ] enchanted links
- [ ] multi factor authentication (mfa)
- [ ] federation authentication - SAML / OIDC
- [ ] token based authentication

## traditional methods
- [ ] certificate auth
- [ ] password based auth
- [ ] email auth
- [ ] PKI - public key infrastructure auth
- [ ] single sign on
- [ ] database auth
- [ ] remote auth
- [ ] server / network based auth

## new auth methods
- [ ] MFA - multi factor auth
- [ ] 2FA - two factor auth
- [ ] biometric auth
- [ ] token auth
- [ ] behavioral auth
- [ ] qr code auth
- [ ] blockchain auth
- [ ] passwordless auth
- [ ] adaptive auth
- [ ] cryptography auth
- [ ] oauth
- [ ] oauth v2
- [ ] payment auth
- [ ] wireless auth

this is a list complied after a quick google sesh. i think this gives us a good enough list of things to choose out of. 

lets begin.
